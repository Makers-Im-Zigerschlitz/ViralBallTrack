# ViralBallTrack
Simple and cheap set for a modular ball track to sweeten up life in quarantine in times of COVID-19


This project is in development. We are trying to get it right before we send it out to the world - still development is open for everyone.

## The idea
- Define the dimensions/possibilities and limitations for a modular ball track.
- Create a simple and cheap set with 3D-printed parts for a ball lift mechanism. 
- Makerspaces / Hackerspaces all over the world can adopt this idea, produce kits and sell these for a modest price (some income for their local makerspace / hackerspace / library / etc.)
- Make videos / pictures with the #ViralBallTrack and feed social media
- As soon as the times of social distancing are over we can gather in communal, regional, statewide, nationwide or international events to set our ball tracks next to each other and let some marbles / bearing-balls roll.
